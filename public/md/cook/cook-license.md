# Â© LICENSE

The ```licence``` command helps you manage **open-source licenses** for your project.
You can list available licenses, choose one to apply or get a preview of the any available license.

## The ```licenses``` :

| License Name             | Open Source          | TL;DR                                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **MIT**                  | âœ… Yes                | Super permissive. Use it, modify it, just keep the license notice. |
| **Apache 2.0**           | âœ… Yes                | Like MIT but adds a patent grant. Safe for businesses.             |
| **GPL-3.0**              | âœ… Yes                | Copy-left. If you distribute, your code must also be open.         |
| **LGPL-3.0**             | âœ… Yes                | Lighter GPLâ€”used often in libraries.                               |
| **BSD 2-Clause**         | âœ… Yes                | Simple, permissive, similar to MIT.                                |
| **BSD 3-Clause**         | âœ… Yes                | Like BSD-2 but adds "No endorsement" clause.                       |
| **MPL-2.0**              | âœ… Yes                | Weak copy-left. Only modified files must be open.                  |
| **Unlicense / none.txt** | âœ… (or Public Domain) | Total freedom. No conditions.                                      |

#  What Isn't Open Source?
If you add something like closed.txt or your own custom restrictive license, thatâ€™s **not open-source** unless it explicitly grants the four freedoms:

* To use
* To study
* To modify
* To distribute

# Arguments : ```list```, ```gen```, ```show```

### ```--list```
The ```list``` arg displays all available **open-source license** templates built into the cook CLI.

It lets you quickly see which licenses you can choose from when generating a new license file.
```bash
username@Userpc:~/Project$ cook licence list

LICENCE LIST
  1. APACHE-2
  2. BSD-2
  3. BSD-3
  4. CLOSED
  5. GPL
  6. LGPL
  7. MIT
  8. MPL-2
  9. BASIC
```
<hr>

### ```--gen```

The ```gen``` arg generates a license file based on the selected license and drops it into your current working directory.

```bash
username@Userpc:~/Project$ cook licence gen

[?] Please select a license for your project: 
 > APACHE-2
   BSD-2
   BSD-3
   CLOSED
   GPL
   LGPL
   MIT
   MPL-2
   BASIC
```
Then you write the name you want in the license.
```bash
Selected license: APACHE-2
Please enter your project name: NAME
LICENSE file created successfully.
```
<hr>

### ```--show```
The ```show``` arg lets you preview any license template before applying it to your project.

You can browse the exact contents of a license (like MIT, GPL, Apache, etc.) and read its terms.

```bash
username@Userpc:~/Project$ cook licence show

[?] Please select a license for your project: 
   APACHE-2
   BSD-2
   BSD-3
   CLOSED
   GPL
   LGPL
   MIT
   MPL-2
 >  BASIC
```
It will show you the preview of the selected license.
```bash
Selected license: BASIC
